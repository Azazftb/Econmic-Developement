# Economic Pulse: Tracking Employment Shifts Across Canadian Sectors 📊

## Project Overview
This project was done for our class CP321 (Data Visualization). We utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python to analyze a dataset covering employment figures in Canada from 2006 to 2023, categorized by NAICS sectors. Our process included data cleaning, formulating a research question, and creating visualizations using Matplotlib or Plotly to convey insights. Our project documentation includes an Introduction, Proposed Approach, and Visualization Description and Analysis sections, ensuring a clear presentation of our findings and message to the audience.

Our work aims to understand how different sectors have responded to major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify sectors that demonstrate resilience or volatility under economic pressures.

## Motivation
With Canada's job market being both diverse and subject to global and local economic fluctuations, it becomes crucial for policymakers, investors, and individuals to understand these dynamics. This project simplifies the visualization of employment trends, offering insights that facilitate informed decision-making.

## Objectives
- **Resilience Identification**: Highlight sectors that have consistently withstood economic shocks. 🛡️
- **Growth and Concern Detection**: Point out areas showing significant growth or decline, guiding effective strategy formulation for stakeholders. 📈

## Data Source 📁
The dataset used for this analysis, provided by Statistics Canada, encompasses monthly employment rates by sector, covering the period from 2006 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset allows for a detailed examination of employment dynamics within the Canadian economy.

## Visualization Techniques 📊
To effectively communicate our findings, we employ several visualization techniques:
- **Line Graphs**: Trace the overall employment trends across all industries.
- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Facilitate comparative analysis of employment trends across key sectors.
- **Area Charts**: Emphasize the volume and changes in employment over time, highlighting responses to economic downturns.
- **Heatmaps**: Illustrate year-over-year percentage changes in employment, enabling quick identification of sectors with significant shifts.
- **Scatter Plots**: Explore relationships and dependencies between various sectors, highlighting interconnectedness and sector-specific trends.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Dataframe management and operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating static, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
